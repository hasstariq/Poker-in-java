# Poker-in-java
The game of poker, specifically Texas Hold ‘em is one that is deceivingly complex. The number of possibilities as well as factoring in the decisions of opponents leads to a complicated decision making process. Our system aims to recreate the experience of a game against AI opponents while also offering the user the optimal play to make as a means for teaching new player to understand the game, or even help veterans in an unfamiliar circumstance

## Scope
Create a playable environment which is user friendly, both in operation and appearance
This environment will house both AI opponents to carry out an actual game as well as a “helper tool” to present optimal moves.
This system is created in Java and will solely be accessible by computer application.
There is a heavy emphasis on user friendliness in order to make the application as intuitive as possible, especially for new players.

## Definitions 
Player: Refers to the user of the software
Bot/AI Opponent: Refers to an automated “player” created for the purpose of practicing the game

## Overview
The Poker Assistant Tool was created as a java based application, meant for poker players of all skill ranges, new to veteran. The game of poker is quite challenging and very daunting in the range of possibilities and probabilities that could occur. The goal of this system is to guide players to make the correct choices and eventually familiarize themselves, or master the game of poker. By recognizing patterns in optimal moves this application aims to increase the skills of its users.

There are two windows that the player is presented with. First, the table UI, displays the game information as well as serving as the interface in which the player is able to input their decisions, such as raising or folding, etc.. The second, the “helper window” displays the optimal move that the system recommends the player based upon their hand as well as the cards shown on the table.
